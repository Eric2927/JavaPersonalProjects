			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p>This class focuses on mathematical modeling and real-life applications of mathematics. We also cover a lot of competition-style math problems and concepts. This course is taught by <a href="https://www.massacademy.org/about/faculty/thomas-regele/">Mr. Thomas Regele</a>. He has tackled a bull before! Check out his <a href="https://www1.eboard.com/eboard/servlet/BoardServlet?ACTION=BOARD_SHOW&SITE_NAME=Destination&BOARD_NAME=tjregs&SESSION_ID=1jwqthwnuj6ut9025">website</a> for more information.

			<h3>A Term</h3>
			<p>So far, A term has been all about solving competition-style math problems in various groups and presenting our methods. The most notable problem was the irregular tetrahedron question. The course is heavily discussion-based so far, and it is really enjoyable because of it. As the term progressed, we start moving towards modeling problems with a program called Mathematica.</p>

			<h3>B Term</h3>
			<p>During B Term, we modeled more problems and every night, we would do practice competition-style problems. In the middle of B Term, everyone participated in this competition called HiMCM (High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling) where we chose groups of up to four people to solve a large, real-life problem in 36 hours. Even though the competition guidelines changed this year from a 36-hour competition to a 11-day competition, our schedule was shaped so well for a 36-hour window that we competed as if it was a 36-hour competition. Each year, there are two problems for groups to choose from. This year, the first problem was about roller coasters and creating objective thrill ratings given a multitude of parameters for over 300 roller coasters. The second problem involved designing a smart home climate system that must satisfy many requirements, such as the ability to accurately predict the home owner's leaving and returning to adjust the temperature accordingly. We chose to do the first problem.</p>
