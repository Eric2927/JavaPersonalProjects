			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p>This course has two tracks: one with calculus and the other with algebra. Both tracks are taught at the same time, and students who take the calculus track must use calculus methods to solve problems and have special questions they have to answer on tests. This class is taught by <a href="https://www.massacademy.org/about/faculty/william-ellis/">Mr. William Ellis</a>. Check out his website <a href="http://mrellis.com:8000/">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>A Term</h3>
			<p>Since I had some past experience in physics, I chose to take the calculus track. That may have been a mistake. We covered many topics in A Term, beginning with one-dimensional kinematics and finishing the term with forces. Every unit, we would have an Uber problem where we have to solve a challenge problem related to the unit and provide a formal write up for the solution.</p>

			<h3>B Term</h3>
			<p>During B Term, we focused a lot on forces and energy. We learned about types of collisions, springs, etc.</p>
