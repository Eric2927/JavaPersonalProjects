			<p>The A Term was almost solely focused on Thoreau's Walden, which was our summer reading assignment for this course. Our first project was implemented on the second day of school; it entailed the drafting of a skit based on Thoreau's Walden and the performance of that skit at Camp Bournedale.</p>
