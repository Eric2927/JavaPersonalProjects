			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p>As a junior, I am enrolled in the Advanced Computer Science class. This course is taught by <a href="https://www.massacademy.org/about/faculty/angela-taricco">Mrs. Angela Taricco</a>. This course focuses on java and implements a total of three major projects over the course of the four terms. The first project is actually the production and maintenance of this website. The second project is the development of a software product and the final project is the development of a mobile application that solves some problem in the real world. The course offers a comprehensive overview of the basics of object-oriented programming and uses the eclipse IDE environment to code.</p>

			<h3>A Term</h3>
			<p>We began the school year with HTML and learning how to design a website (as you see here). This was a big portion of A Term, but towards the end of A Term, we were introduced to java and started coding simple programs (examples not worth showing).</p>

			<h3>B Term</h3>
			<p>Throughout B Term, we explored java extensively. Here are two of the programs I coded.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Click <a href="docs/SieveOfEratosthenes.pdf">here</a> to see a program I coded that asks the user for an upper bound and proceeds to find all the prime numbers up to that upper bound. It is based on the concept of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Click <a href="docs/GuessANumber.pdf">here</a> to see a program I coded that simulates a guessing game where a random number between 1 and 100 is generated and the user is prompted to guess the number:</p>

			<h3>C and D Terms (Apps for Good)</h3>
			<p>At the beginning of C term, we were introduced to the Apps for Good project, where we were put into groups to make an application that benefits the society. However, while other groups are doing separate projects for Apps for Good and STEM II, our group combined the two into a mega-project that involves both hardware and software. I was placed in a group with Bharath Heggadahalli and Anna He.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Our client was a person who was afflicted with dementia. As a result, our client would often forget to drink water. To fix this, our group embarked on a journey to design a water bottle that tracks the water consumption of the user and reminds the user to drink water if they are not drinking enough. The software portion of this will be discussed on this page, as it is the computer science portion. The hardware will be discussed on the STEM page.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In order to track water consumption and show the data to the user, we decided to link the water bottle component with a mobile application. We used a bluetooth low energy module in the base of the water bottle and connected it to the application that way. When it is connected, the weight data from the water bottle would be transmitted to the app and the application would process the data to calculate the number of ounces drank. The app will then display the relevant data on the interface and save some of it to Firebase in order to display past data on one of the pages of the app in graphs. For the app coding, java was used in conjunction with XML. Pictures of the app's user interface are seen on our <a href="docs/AFGBoard.pdf">Apps for Good poster</a>. Click <a href="https://github.com/the-three-droplets/AppsForGood">here</a> to see the Github repository containing all of our code.</p>
