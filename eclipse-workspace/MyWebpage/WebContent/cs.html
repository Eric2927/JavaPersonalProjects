			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p>As a junior, I am enrolled in the Advanced Computer Science class. This course is taught by <a href="https://www.massacademy.org/about/faculty/angela-taricco">Mrs. Angela Taricco</a>. This course focuses on java and implements a total of three major projects over the course of the four terms. The first project is actually the production and maintenance of this website. The second project is the development of a software product and the final project is the development of a mobile application that solves some problem in the real world. The course offers a comprehensive overview of the basics of object-oriented programming and uses the eclipse IDE environment to code.</p>

			<h3>A Term</h3>
			<p>We began the school year with HTML and learning how to design a website (as you see here). This was a big portion of A Term, but towards the end of A Term, we were introduced to java and started coding simple programs (examples not worth showing).</p>

			<h3>B Term</h3>
			<p>Throughout B Term, we explored java extensively. Here are two of the programs I coded.</p>

			<p>Click <a href="docs/SieveOfEratosthenes.pdf">here</a> to see a program I coded that asks the user for an upper bound and proceeds to find all the prime numbers up to that upper bound. It is based on the concept of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>

			<p>Click <a href="docs/GuessANumber.pdf">here</a> to see a program I coded that simulates a guessing game where a random number between 1 and 100 is generated and the user is prompted to guess the number:</p>
