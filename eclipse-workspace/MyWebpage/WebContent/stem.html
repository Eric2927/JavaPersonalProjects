			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p>STEM is a course which focuses on two projects the whole year. The first project would be presented at science fairs in December and February, and the grades of the first three terms are almost purely based on the project. The second project is introduced in the middle of C term (when the first project would be done) and that would be what we do for the rest of the year. This course is taught by <a href="https://www.massacademy.org/about/faculty/siobhan-curran/">Mrs. Siobhan Curran</a>.</p>

			<h3>A Term (STEM I)</h3>
			<p>This term was largely based on brainstorming for an original project idea. The project has to be unique and never done before. I decided that I will most likely be doing a project on music temperament, though it does not seem promising.</p>

			<h3>B Term (STEM I)</h3>
			<p>During B Term, we mainly focused on getting the paperwork done and working on the project. I decided on the music temperament idea, and that's what I worked on for most of B term. We would have regular weekly checks, where we submit our progress to the teachers and we can get feedback on what to fix and how to proceed. Besides working directly on our projects, we also learned about certain statistical tests we can use to evaluate our work.</p>
