			<h3>Course Description</h3>
			<p>This course is generally called language, though there are four subclasses in this course: Intermediate Spanish, Advanced Spanish, Intermediate French, and Advanced French. The placement is determined by a diagnostic test on orientation day. Because of my past experience in French, I was placed in the Advanced French class. All four classes are taught by <a href="https://www.massacademy.org/about/faculty/julia-wildfong/">Mrs. Julia Wildfong</a>. This course is focused on personal improvement, and someone's grade is solely based on how much he/she improved.</p>

			<h3>A Term</h3>
			<p>We began the year with the Beauty and the Beast. Using that as a basis, we explored several verb tenses, such as the passe simple. Everyone started with varying levels of French experience, so it was difficult at first. But we eventually reached a common ground.</p>

			<h3>B Term</h3>
			<p>During B Term, we were assigned a year-long project where we are split into multiple groups and create 5-minute films in French. About one day a week, we take time to examine the properties of a good film and how to incorporate it into our own films. For the other days of each week, we worked on various assignments such as deciphering french songs, reading, watching, and writing fairy tales, and group projects. Each term, we have to keep a vocabulary list.</p>
